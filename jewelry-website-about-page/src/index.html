			<p class="font"><i>I decided to get into the business of reselling jewelry because I live in Arizona, a very cheap place in the US. I noticed that when I walked into jewelry shops, all the jewelry was discounted. This was where I got the idea of buying and reselling the discounted jewelry to the places that pay a better price for it."</i>
